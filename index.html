                            <li>Most users would place the food item they were heating in the microwave, close the

                            <li>Some users seemed startled / surprised when they pressed one of the numbers, in the

                                cook” section, and the microwave immediately started with the cook time set to the
                                number of
                                minutes pressed.

                            <li>When the food was done and the alarm went off most users were quick to open the
